# hw.tempmon - Hardware Temp Monitor

This project was designed to run on a Raspberry Pi with a GPIO-connected TMP36 stepsister to read the ambient air temperature on a configured interval and send the data to a configured API. I should have documented soldering the circuit for this project, but it can be found online.
